## Methods
<!-- where I log the developments of my thinkings  -->
### [T = $ $, S = $ $] Brute Force
...

### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Dual-pointer
Non-zero numbers care about order, but zeroes don't. So instead of swapping zeroes to the end, we swap every non-zero numbers to the front in the order we meet them. Thus maintain 2 pointers, one pointing to the next zero to be swapped, the other iterating through the array.

## Boundary Case
<!-- where I log the boundary conditions to think of. -->
- All-zeroes, e.g. [0, 0, 0]
- Non-zero array, e.g. [1, 2, 3]

## Mappings
<!-- where I build mappings to related topics and log developments. -->
