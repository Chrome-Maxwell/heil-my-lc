# 15. 3Sum

## Methods
<!-- where I log the developments of my thinkings  -->
### [T = $O(n^3)$, S = $O(1)$] Brute Force
Enumerates all combinations of three elements.

### [T = $O(n^2)$, S = $O(1)$] Dual-pointer
Essentially equivalent to the method of enumeration, but excludes many invalid combinations.

## Boundary Case
<!-- where I log the boundary conditions to think of. -->
- Array with repetitive elements, e.g. [-1, 1, 0, -1, 1]
- All-zeros array, e.g. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

## Mappings
<!-- where I build mappings to related topics and log developments. -->
