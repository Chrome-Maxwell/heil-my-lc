# 189. Rotate Array

## Methods
<!-- where I log the developments of my thinkings  -->
### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(n)$] Brute Force 
Intuitive way. Create an extra array then fill in each entry with the kth-shifted entry value.

### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Iterative Swap
We shift the elements "pairwisely" by maintaining a "tmp" value to prevent overwriting. We place an element x to k-th shifted position, then shift element on that position to its k-th shifted position... until we iterate back to the original position.

However, returning to the original position does not guarantee that we iterate through all elements. Recall what've been taught in discrete mathematics, we need to do this loop on each of the congruence classes of the whole element set. One way to do this is to first calculate the gcd of k and n. Review the code for the implementation details.

### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] * Array Reversion
Definitely better. Observe that for a rotated array:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ->(k=2)-> [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
The [-k: ] elements are moved to the front of the array. Another way to do this is reversing the whole array:
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```
Now the only difference is the reversed order of the [0 : k-1] sub-array and the [-k: ] sub-array respectively. Thus reverse the two sub-arrays:
```
[5, 4,(and) 3, 2, 1] -> [4, 5,(and) 1, 2, 3] 
```
Done.

## Boundary Case
<!-- where I log the boundary conditions to think of. -->
- k is divided by n, e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 8
- n is divided by k e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], k = 2
