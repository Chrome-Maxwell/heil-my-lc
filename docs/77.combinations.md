### [T ~ $O(k * C_n^k)$, S = $O(n)$] Bactracking with pruning
Ensure each path is lexicographical increasing as to avoid repititions. Each time we append a possible choice to the path, and then do deeper backtracking by shrinking the range of choice to only pick larger numbers. After each backtracking, undo the append operation to explore different possibilities of current choice. By pruning we can limit the current-choice range so that numbers that are unlikely to make future path be length k will be pruned out.
