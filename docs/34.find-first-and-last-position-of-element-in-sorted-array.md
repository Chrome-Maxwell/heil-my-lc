# 34. Find First And Last Position of Element in Sorted Array

## Methods
### [T = $O(log(n))$, S = $O(1)$] Binary Search
Two functions, one find the upper bound, the other lower. There're in total three cases:
1. target is beyond the range of the interval
2. target is inside the interval
3. target is inside the range of the interval, but not in the interval
For case 3, the lower bound will be the min of nums that's larger, the upper bound will be the max of nums that's smaller, therefore the lb will be larger than the ub.

## Boundary Case
- interval is empty, e.g. []\n 1
- target out of range, e.g. [1, 2, 3]\n 4
- target within range, but not in interval, e.g. [1, 2, 4]\n 3
