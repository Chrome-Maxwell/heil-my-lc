# 190. Reverse Bits

## Methods
<!-- where I log the developments of my thinkings  -->
### [T = $O(log(n))$, S = $O(1)$] Bit by Bit Re-construct
Extract lowest bit and append it to the end of result, so that the reversed binary string is re-constructed bit by bit.

### [T = $O(1)$, S = $O(1)$] Better: Divide & Conquer
Divide the reverse problem by two, first exchange the higher 16-bits with lower 16-bits, then exchange the higher and lower 8-bits inside each 16-bits, then exchange 4-bits, and so forth. The bit-masking and other manipulations used in this method are far finer than previous method, and require less operations.
