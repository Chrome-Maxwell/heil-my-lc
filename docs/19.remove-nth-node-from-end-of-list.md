# 19. Remove the N-th Node from the End of List

## Methods
<!-- where I log the developments of my thinkings  -->
### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Brute Force
Loop through the list for two passes: first get end-node, second get the node whose n-th next node is end node, then remove it.

### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Dual-pointer
Keep the faster pointer n-th away from the slower node, loop till the faster node reaches the end node, then it's done. Pay special attention to the boudary cases.

## Boundary Case
<!-- where I log the boundary conditions to think of. -->
- Single node list, e.g. [1], n = 1
- Removed node is the head, e.g. [1, 2, 3], n = 3 (This case needs extra conditional checking)
