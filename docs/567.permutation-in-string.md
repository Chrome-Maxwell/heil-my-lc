## Methods
<!-- where I log the developments of my thinkings  -->
### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Slidig Window
Permutations require the match of char set. First count the chars in `s1`. Maintain an interval of length `s1.length()`, incrementally log the chars count within the window, and check if it matches with the chars count of `s1`.

## Boundary Case
<!-- where I log the boundary conditions to think of. -->

## Mappings
<!-- where I build mappings to related topics and log developments. -->
