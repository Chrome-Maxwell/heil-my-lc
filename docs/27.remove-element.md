# 27. Remove Element

## Methods
### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Single Pointer
Maintain a pointer `p` always pointing to a right-most non-target element. Iterate through the array from left, when finding a target element, swap with the non-target element, then move `p` to fix the constraint

### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Dual Pointer
The general idea is to iterate through all elements of the array and "collect" all non-target element to the leftmost part. We iterate through the array from left, so the left part is already visited and can be overwritten without risk. Maintain two pointers, `p1` is the slow pointer, with a constraint that its element and all elements by its left are non-target; `p2` is the fast pointer that iterate through the array one by one. We will overwrite the element under `p1` with element pointed by `p2`, only if the fast pointer points to a non-target value. When `p2 == end`, that means every element is processed.

## Boundary Case
- empty, e.g. []\n 2
- empty after removing, e.g. [1]\n 1
- complex case, e.g. [0,4,4,0,4,4,4,0,2]\n 4
