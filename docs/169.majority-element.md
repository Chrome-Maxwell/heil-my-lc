# 169. Majority Element

## Methods
### [T = $O(n)$, S = $O(1)$] Boyer-Moore Voting

Here I use Moore voting algorithm to determine the majority as it is designed for. First thing first, pick an element as "selected" and set "vote counter" to 1. Iterate through the array and each time a same element presents, vote + 1; for different element, vote - 1; whenever the counter is 0 the current element is "vote down". It's trivial that the majority will win at last.
## Boundary Case
- x, e.g. ...
- y, e.g. ...
- z, e.g. ...
